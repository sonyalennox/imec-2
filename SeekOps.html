    <h1><u>SeekOps</u></h1>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>

    <h3>
    <p>There is increasing market demand for fugitive emission leak detection technologies and services to meet regulatory requiremnets. iMEC has strategically partnered with SeekOps whom provide such technologies that can be used to detect, locate, and quantify leak with high fidelity. Utilizing drones provides the smallest, safest, and most effective way to position our sensor technology in 3D space, ensuring comprehensive emission inspection surveys each and every time. Our end-to-end service offerings have been independently validated to be more efficient and effective than the status quo. Autonomous UAS flight modes provide for rapid and repeatable inspection operations, especially in areas which are difficult to access</p>

    <p>SeekIR is SeekOps proprietary miniaturized methane sensor with ultra accurate resolution for leak grading. Paired with our software suite, hyper-accurate GPS, and custom algorithms, the SeekIR package offers localized, quantified emissions leak data for field operations. SeekOps SeekIR sensors are 100x lighter and 1000x more sensitive than other miniature sensor technologies and are uniquely suited for deployment on drone. SeekIR reliably detects natural gas emissions as low as 1 SCFH at distances up to 300 feet.</p>

    <p>Our systems operate in concert with our custom data analytics suite, to rapidly localize point source emissions and quantify or grade emissions rates. Data access and archival is provided in near-real-time through a secure online portal, streamlining reporting and record keeping.</p>

    <h2>Full Service - From Data Collecting to Reporting.</h2>

    <h3>
     iMEC's experienced UAS field teams only work in the energy sector where Health, Environment, and Safety are paramount. Our pilots are experts in oilfield drone deployment and will operate safely for every mission. SeekOps has conducted missions globally including United States, Canada, Europe, and the Middle East. The SeekIR technology was developed at NASA by the founders of SeekOps. SeekOps has customized the core technology to be ideally suited for commercial emmissions inspection to find and investigate leaks rapidly and accurately. Our team has extensive experience in the oil and gas industry originally through field trial applications and now in widespread operational use as a commercial solution      
    </h3>

    <h2>Leveraging technology and our oil and gas industry expertise enabling customers to:</h2>

    <h3>
        <ol type="1">
            <li>Ensure system safety</li>
            <li>Maintain mass balance and peak performance</li>
            <li>Meet or exceed regulatory compliance</li>
        </ol>
    </h3>

    <h3>
    Today's practice of sending field teams to inspect for leaks is time consuming and dangerous; and using thermal cameras means having to look through hours of video without guaranteering meaningful results. With SeekIR you et the data you need quickly, in a format which integrates easily with your existing control sofware to provide you with actionable results.
