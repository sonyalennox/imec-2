<h2><u>SeekOps</u></h2>
<h3>
  <p>
    Due to the increasing market demand for fugitive emission leak detection,
iMEC has strategically partnered with SeekOps in Canada to detect, locate,
and quantify leaks with high fidelity. Utilizing drones provides the smallest,
safest, and most effective way to position our sensor technology in 3D space,
ensuring comprehensive emission inspection surveys each and every time.
Our end-to-end service offerings have been independently validated to be
more efficient and effective than the status quo. Autonomous UAS flight
modes provide for rapid and repeatable inspection operations, especially in
areas which are difficult to access.
  </p>
  <p>
    SeekIR® is SeekOps proprietary miniaturized methane sensor with ultra
accurate resolution for leak grading. Paired with our software suite, hyper-
accurate GPS, and custom algorithms, the SeekIR package offers localized,
quantified emissions leak data for field operations. SeekOps SeekIR sensors
are 100x lighter and 1000x more sensitive than other miniature sensor
technologies and are uniquely suited for deployment on drones. SeekIR
reliably detects natural gas emissions as low as 1 SCFH at distances up to
300 feet.

<h2><u>Fluenta</u></h2>
<h3>
  <p>Exploration for oil and gas remains the critical industry for energy supply. The oil and gas industry has to deal with some of the most dangerous and toxic materials in often challenging and hostile environments. Safety and accuracy are not only essential prerequisites to successful projects, these values are ingrained into the DNA of the oil and gas industry.</p>

  <p>Oil and gas platforms need to release gases safely. This may be to reduce sudden increases in pressure, or to ensure safe plant start-ups or shut-downs.</p>

  <p>Releasing potentially toxic gases into the air is more risky and less environmentally safe than burning gas through a flare stack. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the United States has estimated that when gas is flared rather than vented, the emissions of volatile organic chemicals and hazardous air pollutants could be reduced by around a factor of 4.</p>

  <p>To comply with safety regulations and government emissions standards, flare stacks need to be monitored. Fluenta has more than 30 years’ expertise in the accurate measurement of flare gas. Using ultrasound technology combined with bespoke measurement techniques, Fluenta’s products are recognised globally for their accuracy and reliability.</p>

  <p>Fluenta’s products have been deployed thousands of times across the globe including with trusted oil and gas brands such as BP, Exxon, Shell, Equinor, and Total.</p>

  <p>Our commitment to R&D means that we are constantly improving the accuracy of our product range, delivering innovative technology to the market.</p>
